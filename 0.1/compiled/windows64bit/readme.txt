MATLAB Compiler

1. Prerequisites for Deployment 

. Verify the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR) is installed and ensure you    
  have installed version 7.13.   

. If the MCR is not installed, run MCRInstaller, located in:

  <mcr_root>*\toolbox\compiler\deploy\win64\MCRInstaller.exe

For more information on the MCR Installer, see the MATLAB Compiler 
documentation.    


NOTE: Prior to running your deployed application, verify the user locale
      and system locales have the same value on the Microsoft Windows 
      platform. If these values are not the same, you might see an I18n 
      warning message and garbled text.

2. Files to Deploy and Package

Files to package for Standalone 
================================
-cidre.exe
-MCRInstaller.exe 
   -include when building component by selecting "include MCR" option 
    in deploytool
-This readme file 

3. Definitions

MCR - MATLAB Compiler uses the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR), 
which is a standalone set of shared libraries that enable the execution 
of M-files. The MCR provides complete support for all features of 
MATLAB without the MATLAB GUI. When you package and distribute an 
application to users, you include supporting files generated by the 
builder as well as the MATLAB Compiler Runtime (MCR). If necessary, 
run MCRInstaller to install version 7.13 of MCR. For more 
information about the MCR, see the MATLAB Compiler documentation.




* NOTE: <mcr_root> is the directory where MCR is installed on the target machine.


4. Appendix 

A. On the target machine, add the MCR directory to the system path    
   specified by the target system's environment variable. 


    i. Locate the name of the environment variable to set, using the  
       table below:

    Operating System        Environment Variable
    ================        ====================
    Windows                 PATH


     ii. Set the path by doing one of the following:

        NOTE: <mcr_root> is the directory where MCR is installed
              on the target machine.         

        On Windows systems:

        . Add the MCR directory to the environment variable by opening 
        a command prompt and issuing the DOS command:

            set PATH=<mcr_root>\v713\runtime\win64;%PATH% 

        Alternately, for Windows, add the following pathname:
            <mcr_root>\v713\runtime\win64
        to the PATH environment variable, by doing the following:
            1. Select the My Computer icon on your desktop.
            2. Right-click the icon and select Properties from the menu.
            3. Select the Advanced tab.
            4. Click Environment Variables.  



        NOTE: On Windows, the environment variable syntax utilizes 
              backslashes (\), delimited by semi-colons (;).
